      <description>In this blog, I aim at explaining a very popular coding interview question to my readers, commonly known as Sliding Window Maximum, this formally goes like this
 Given an array A and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.
 Sample Input : arr = [9,6,11,8,10,5,4,13,93,14], window_size = 4 Sample Output : 11,11,11,10,13,93,93
I would be touching upon all the ineffective approaches, but would no go in depth for those.</description>

      <description>What is a Maze Runner? According to Wikipedia, in electronic design automation, a maze runner is a connection routing method that represents the entire routing space as a grid. Parts of this grid are blocked by components, specialised areas, or already present wiring. The grid size corresponds to the wiring pitch of the area. The goal is to find a chain of grid cells that go from point A to point B.</description>
