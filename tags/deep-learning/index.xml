      <description>Intro To Neural Networks with PyTorch Deep learning networks tend to be massive with dozens or hundreds of layers, that&amp;rsquo;s where the term &amp;ldquo;deep&amp;rdquo; comes from. PyTorch has a nice module nn that provides a nice way to efficiently build large neural networks. Let us together explore it in this blog.

      <title>Hiding Input Cells On Jupyter Notebook</title>

      <description>Why Needed ? Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t want to show the code during presentation of the notebook, or sometimes the code can look really clumsy. Taking care of the code while tearing your hairs to find a better solution to a problem simultaneously is quite a mammoth task. Most tutorials on the web would suggest you to install nbextensions, an open-source notebook extension package for Jupyter notebooks. Definitely that is clean and easy, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t like installing things and junking up my workstation, rather I&amp;rsquo;d write a custom code to solve the problem.</description>
