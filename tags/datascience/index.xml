      <title>Hiding Input Cells On Jupyter Notebook</title>

      <description>Why Needed ? Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t want to show the code during presentation of the notebook, or sometimes the code can look really clumsy. Taking care of the code while tearing your hairs to find a better solution to a problem simultaneously is quite a mammoth task. Most tutorials on the web would suggest you to install nbextensions, an open-source notebook extension package for Jupyter notebooks. Definitely that is clean and easy, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t like installing things and junking up my workstation, rather I&amp;rsquo;d write a custom code to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>Introduction Numpy is a python library that provides functions that are especially useful when you have to work with large arrays and matrices of numeric data, like doing matrix matrix multiplications. Also, Numpy is battle tested and optimized so that it runs fast, much faster than if you were working with Python lists directly.
The array object class is the foundation of Numpy, and Numpy arrays are like lists in Python, except that every thing inside an array must be of the same type, like int or float.</description>
